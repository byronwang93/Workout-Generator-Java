# My Personal Project

## Workout Simulator

**I plan on creating a project that simulates a workout plan** based on some given inputs from the user, where
the inputs include:
- the intensity of workout you desire
- the body part/muscle group you would like to work on
- whether or not you have access to gym equipment

As someone who does a workout every night with my dad at home, there's only a few options of what we can do, so by 
building this project, not only do I hope to gain experience on the process of designing and creating a personal project, but also in hopes to
explore more fitness variations to incorporate into my daily life.
